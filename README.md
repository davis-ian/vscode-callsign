# Callsign – OpenAPI Explorer & HTTP Client for VS Code

Callsign is a modern, developer-first OpenAPI extension for VS Code that turns your Swagger spec into an interactive API explorer and HTTP client—without leaving your editor.

Whether you're building or consuming APIs, Callsign is your all-in-one:

-   VS Code OpenAPI Explorer
-   Swagger Viewer in VS Code
-   OpenAPI Client for VS Code
-   Swagger UI Alternative
-   HTTP Client built for Swagger
-   TypeScript Codegen for OpenAPI

---

## ✨ Features

-   🔍 **OpenAPI Viewer**
    Instantly browse your OpenAPI spec in a fast, readable UI—grouped by tag like Swagger UI, but native to VS Code.

-   ⚙️ **Expandable Endpoints**
    Click to expand any route and view method, description, path parameters, and more.

-   🧩 **VS Code Native**
    Designed to feel right at home inside your editor, using native APIs and webviews.

-   💻 **No Context Switching**
    Stay inside your dev environment—no tabs, no clutter.

-   🧪 **API Request Panel**
    Preview and send real requests with headers, path and query params.

-   👀 **cURL Preview**
    Instantly preview a fully-formed `curl` command based on the request panel inputs.

-   🛠️ **Code Generation**
    Generate TypeScript clients using `openapi-typescript-codegen` directly from a saved spec.

-   🧑‍🍳 **Mock Server Support (planned)**
    Preview and simulate endpoints without needing the backend live.

---

## 📦 Usage

1. **Open Command Palette** → `Callsign: Show Commands`
   Or use the default shortcut: `ctrl+c ctrl+k`

2. **Choose a spec** from saved URLs or paste a new OpenAPI spec URL

3. **Browse** endpoints grouped by tag

4. **Click any route** to view its method, summary, parameters, and schema (if available)

> Want to test the API or generate code? That's next on the roadmap—stay tuned!
